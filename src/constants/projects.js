        description: "While working at CloudEngage I was tasked with working on the front and back end of all of the major features, services and products offered. Since it was a pretty small engineering team of only 3-6 engineers, I had the opprtunity to work on all aspects of the platform. My main tasks were handling our Alert feature, Chord Messaing Service, automated email system for various email automation needs, and the billing system through Stripe. Chord, the chat messaging service, was my prime focus as I was the lead developer on that service. Due to my work at CloudEngage being proprietary I cannot post any code samples but you can view a demo of CloudEngage at https://retail.gocloudengage.com/"

I joined on and was tasked with working on an electron app that acts as the launcher for the mod and Sims. The launcher has multiple features including logging in using firebase auth, a friend system, personal profiles, and a host/connect system in order to link people together over LAN/UPnP/etc"
